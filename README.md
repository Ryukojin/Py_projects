# Python projects repository
My portfolio of the various Python projects I wrote as part of my learning.

## Projects:

- ### [File rename](https://github.com/Ryukojin/Py_projects/tree/master/file_rename)
      A script that renames your files based on the regex pattern.

- ### [File transfer tool](https://github.com/Ryukojin/Py_projects/tree/master/Backup_files)
      A file transfer script I wrote to automate to perform my monthly backups in my external HDD.
